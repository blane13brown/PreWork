Submitted by: Blane Brown

Time spent: 10 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Added a slider for more custom tip amounts
- [x] Added a settings screen
- [x] Added an option to change party size up to 10 to divide total bill evenly
- [x] Created an app icon to match the theme of the app

## Notes

I have never developed anything on a mac before so it was very new to me. I also have never programmed in swift or used xcode so it was all a big learning curve. While I dont find swift to be that hard of a language to write in, I do have issues trying to get stuff to look the way I want (colors, ect) because I have not yet learnt how to fully control all the visuals in code.
